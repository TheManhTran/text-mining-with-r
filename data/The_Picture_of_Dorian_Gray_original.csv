174,THE PREFACE,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The artist is the creator of beautiful things.  To reveal art and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,conceal the artist is art's aim.  The critic is he who can translate,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,things.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,being charming.  This is a fault.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,cultivated.  For these there is hope.  They are the elect to whom,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,beautiful things mean only beauty.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book.  Books are well,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"written, or badly written.  That is all.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,his own face in a glass.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,not seeing his own face in a glass.  The moral life of man forms part,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,in the perfect use of an imperfect medium.  No artist desires to prove,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,anything.  Even things that are true can be proved.  No artist has,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,ethical sympathies.  An ethical sympathy in an artist is an,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,unpardonable mannerism of style.  No artist is ever morbid.  The artist,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,can express everything.  Thought and language are to the artist,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,instruments of an art.  Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"an art.  From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the art of the musician.  From the point of view of feeling, the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,actor's craft is the type.  All art is at once surface and symbol.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.  Those who read,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the symbol do so at their peril.  It is the spectator, and not life,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that art really mirrors.  Diversity of opinion about a work of art,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.  When critics disagree,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the artist is in accord with himself.  We can forgive a man for making,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,a useful thing as long as he does not admire it.  The only excuse for,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,               All art is quite useless.,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,CHAPTER 1,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,swiftness and motion.  The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,seemed to make the stillness more oppressive.  The dim roar of London,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,strange conjectures.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"face, and seemed about to linger there.  But he suddenly started up,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,feared he might awake.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,"" said",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Lord Henry languidly.  ""You must certainly send it next year to the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Grosvenor.  The Academy is too large and too vulgar.  Whenever I have,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"I have not been able to see the people, which was worse.  The Grosvenor",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"is really the only place.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I don't think I shall send it anywhere,"" he answered, tossing his head",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Oxford.  ""No, I won't send it anywhere.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette.  ""Not send it anywhere?  My",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dear fellow, why?  Have you any reason?  What odd chaps you painters",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,are!  You do anything in the world to gain a reputation.  As soon as,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"you have one, you seem to want to throw it away.  It is silly of you,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and that is not being talked about.  A portrait like this would set you,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I know you will laugh at me,"" he replied, ""but I really can't exhibit",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"it.  I have put too much of myself into it.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"were so vain; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you--well, of course you have an",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"intellectual expression and all that.  But beauty, real beauty, ends",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,where an intellectual expression begins.  Intellect is in itself a mode,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face.  The moment one",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,horrid.  Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"How perfectly hideous they are!  Except, of course, in the Church.  But",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,then in the Church they don't think.  A bishop keeps on saying at the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks.  I feel quite sure of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that.  He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,summer when we want something to chill our intelligence.  Don't flatter,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"yourself, Basil:  you are not in the least like him.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""You don't understand me, Harry,"" answered the artist.  ""Of course I am",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"not like him.  I know that perfectly well.  Indeed, I should be sorry",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,to look like him.  You shrug your shoulders?  I am telling you the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,truth.  There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,faltering steps of kings.  It is better not to be different from one's,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,fellows.  The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,They can sit at their ease and gape at the play.  If they know nothing,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat.  They",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"live as we all should live--undisturbed, indifferent, and without",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"disquiet.  They neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"from alien hands.  Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"are--my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks--we",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Dorian Gray?  Is that his name?"" asked Lord Henry, walking across the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,studio towards Basil Hallward.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Yes, that is his name.  I didn't intend to tell it to you.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""But why not?""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Oh, I can't explain.  When I like people immensely, I never tell their",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,names to any one.  It is like surrendering a part of them.  I have,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,grown to love secrecy.  It seems to be the one thing that can make,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,modern life mysterious or marvellous to us.  The commonest thing is,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,delightful if one only hides it.  When I leave town now I never tell my,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"people where I am going.  If I did, I would lose all my pleasure.  It",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,deal of romance into one's life.  I suppose you think me awfully,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"foolish about it?""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Not at all,"" answered Lord Henry, ""not at all, my dear Basil.  You",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties.  I,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"When we meet--we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,down to the Duke's--we tell each other the most absurd stories with the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"most serious faces.  My wife is very good at it--much better, in fact,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"than I am.  She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"But when she does find me out, she makes no row at all.  I sometimes",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"wish she would; but she merely laughs at me.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,"" said Basil",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden.  ""I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues.  You are an extraordinary,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"fellow.  You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Your cynicism is simply a pose.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush.  The sunlight slipped over,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the polished leaves.  In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch.  ""I am afraid I must be",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"going, Basil,"" he murmured, ""and before I go, I insist on your",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"answering a question I put to you some time ago.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""What is that?"" said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""You know quite well.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I do not, Harry.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Well, I will tell you what it is.  I want you to explain to me why you",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture.  I want the real reason.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I told you the real reason.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""No, you did not.  You said it was because there was too much of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"yourself in it.  Now, that is childish.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Harry,"" said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, ""every",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of the sitter.  The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion.  It is",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the coloured canvas, reveals himself.  The reason I will not exhibit",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"my own soul.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Lord Henry laughed.  ""And what is that?"" he asked.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I will tell you,"" said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,over his face.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I am all expectation, Basil,"" continued his companion, glancing at him.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,"" answered the painter;",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""and I am afraid you will hardly understand it.  Perhaps you will",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"hardly believe it.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the grass and examined it.  ""I am quite sure I shall understand it,"" he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"is quite incredible.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"languid air.  A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,wings.  Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward's heart,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"beating, and wondered what was coming.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""The story is simply this,"" said the painter after some time.  ""Two",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon's. You know we poor,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,remind the public that we are not savages.  With an evening coat and a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"a reputation for being civilized.  Well, after I had been in the room",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,me.  I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale.  A curious sensation",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of terror came over me.  I knew that I had come face to face with some,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,itself.  I did not want any external influence in my life.  You know,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature.  I have always been my",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Then--but I don't know how to explain it to you.  Something seemed to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life.  I had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,exquisite sorrows.  I grew afraid and turned to quit the room.  It was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,not conscience that made me do so:  it was a sort of cowardice.  I take,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"no credit to myself for trying to escape.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Conscience is the trade-name of the firm.  That is all.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I don't believe that, Harry, and I don't believe you do either.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"However, whatever was my motive--and it may have been pride, for I used",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to be very proud--I certainly struggled to the door.  There, of course,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,I stumbled against Lady Brandon.  'You are not going to run away so,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"soon, Mr. Hallward?' she screamed out.  You know her curiously shrill",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"voice?""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,"" said Lord Henry,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I could not get rid of her.  She brought me up to royalties, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"people with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and parrot noses.  She spoke of me as her dearest friend.  I had only,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"met her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me.  I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,nineteenth-century standard of immortality.  Suddenly I found myself,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"stirred me.  We were quite close, almost touching.  Our eyes met again.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all.  It was simply inevitable.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,We would have spoken to each other without any introduction.  I am sure,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of that.  Dorian told me so afterwards.  He, too, felt that we were",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"destined to know each other.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?"" asked his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"companion.  ""I know she goes in for giving a rapid _precis_ of all her",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,guests.  I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"everybody in the room, the most astounding details.  I simply fled.  I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,like to find out people for myself.  But Lady Brandon treats her guests,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods.  She either explains them,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to know.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"anything--oh, yes, plays the piano--or is it the violin, dear Mr.",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Hallward shook his head.  ""You don't understand what friendship is,",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"between people.  I choose my friends for their good looks, my",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,intellects.  A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,I have not got one who is a fool.  They are all men of some,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""My dear fellow, I am not quite serious.  But I can't help detesting my",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,other people having the same faults as ourselves.  I quite sympathize,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of the upper orders.  The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves.  When",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,Basil!  That is the second time you have made that observation.  If one,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,puts forward an idea to a true Englishman--always a rash thing to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,do--he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"it oneself.  Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"with the sincerity of the man who expresses it.  Indeed, the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices.  However, I don't",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""He is all my art to me now,"" said the painter gravely.  ""I sometimes",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"world's history.  The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"some day be to me.  It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"him, sketch from him.  Of course, I have done all that.  But he is much",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,more to me than a model or a sitter.  I won't tell you that I am,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"that art cannot express it.  There is nothing that art cannot express,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"work, is the best work of my life.  But in some curious way--I wonder",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,will you understand me?--his personality has suggested to me an,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style.  I see",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"things differently, I think of them differently.  I can now recreate",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,life in a way that was hidden from me before.  'A dream of form in days,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of thought'--who is it who says that?  I forget; but it is what Dorian,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Gray has been to me.  The merely visible presence of this lad--for he,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,twenty--his merely visible presence--ah!  I wonder can you realize all,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that that means?  Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek.  The harmony of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,soul and body--how much that is!  We in our madness have separated the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,void.  Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me!  You remember,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,but which I would not part with?  It is one of the best things I have,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"ever done.  And why is it so?  Because, while I was painting it, Dorian",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Gray sat beside me.  Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"some time he came back.  ""Harry,"" he said, ""Dorian Gray is to me simply",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"""Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will.  It is a sad thing to think",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty.  That",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"ourselves.  In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place.  The thoroughly",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,well-informed man--that is the modern ideal.  And the mind of the,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"_bric-a-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"its proper value.  I think you will tire first, all the same.  Some day",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"out of drawing, or you won't like his tone of colour, or something.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"will be perfectly cold and indifferent.  It will be a great pity, for",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"it will alter you.  What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase.  There was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,swallows.  How pleasant it was in the garden!  And how delightful other,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"people's emotions were!--much more delightful than their ideas, it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"seemed to him.  One's own soul, and the passions of one's",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,friends--those were the fascinating things in life.  He pictured to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"by staying so long with Basil Hallward.  Had he gone to his aunt's, he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"would have been sure to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,necessity for model lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"importance of those virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"in their own lives.  The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour.  It was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"charming to have escaped all that!  As he thought of his aunt, an idea",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"and don't move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,had rather taken a fancy.  He was so unlike Basil.  They made a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,delightful contrast.  And he had such a beautiful voice.  After a few,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"Henry?  As bad as Basil says?""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray.  All influence",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"virtues are not real to him.  His sins, if there are such things as",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"sins, are borrowed.  He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,actor of a part that has not been written for him.  The aim of life is,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly--that is what each,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of us is here for.  People are afraid of themselves, nowadays.  They",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"one's self.  Of course, they are charitable.  They feed the hungry and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"clothe the beggar.  But their own souls starve, and are naked.  Courage",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,has gone out of our race.  Perhaps we never really had it.  The terror,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"""And yet,"" continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"him, and that he had even in his Eton days, ""I believe that if one man",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream--I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Hellenic ideal--to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,may be.  But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself.  The,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that mars our lives.  We are punished for our refusals.  Every impulse,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us.  The body,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"purification.  Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,or the luxury of a regret.  The only way to get rid of a temptation is,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to yield to it.  Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.  It has been said that,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,realize your youth while you have it.  Don't squander the gold of your,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar.",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,and turned his steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,So that was the story of Dorian Gray's parentage.  Crudely as it had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"strange, almost modern romance.  A beautiful woman risking everything",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,for a mad passion.  A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"hideous, treacherous crime.  Months of voiceless agony, and then a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"child born in pain.  The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man.  Yes; it was an,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"interesting background.  It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"were.  Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"tragic.  Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"blow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,rose the wakening wonder of his face.  Talking to him was like playing,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,upon an exquisite violin.  He answered to every touch and thrill of the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,bow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,influence.  No other activity was like it.  To project one's soul into,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one's",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,passion and youth; to convey one's temperament into another as though,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that--perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"grossly common in its aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil's studio, or could be",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate.  Grace was his, and the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,us.  There was nothing that one could not do with him.  He could be,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,made a Titan or a toy.  What a pity it was that such beauty was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"destined to fade! ...  And Basil?  From a psychological point of view,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"how interesting he was!  The new manner in art, the fresh mode of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"looking at life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of one who was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dim woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"herself, Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,her there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,form whose shadow they made real:  how strange it all was!  He,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"remembered something like it in history.  Was it not Plato, that artist",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"in thought, who had first analyzed it?  Was it not Buonarotti who had",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,century it was strange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"what, without knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the wonderful portrait.  He would seek to dominate him--had already,",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"When he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,had gone in to lunch.  He gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,passed into the dining-room.,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"described by contemporary historians as stoutness.  Next to her sat, on",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry's house in Mayfair.  It",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,long-fringed Persian rugs.  On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that Queen had selected for her device.  Some large blue china jars and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,summer day in London.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Lord Henry had not yet come in.  He was always late on principle, his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,principle being that punctuality is the thief of time.  So the lad was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the pages",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,found in one of the book-cases. The formal monotonous ticking of the,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,away.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"tempest.  She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was never returned, she had kept all her illusions.  She tried to look",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"I find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"gain a reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"who passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives they",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,led.  Some of them fascinated me.  Others filled me with terror.  There,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,was an exquisite poison in the air.  I had a passion for sensations....,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"as you once phrased it, must have something in store for me.  I fancied",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"of life.  I don't know what I expected, but I went out and wandered",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,grassless squares.  About half-past eight I passed by an absurd little,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills.  A hideous",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar.  He had greasy",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"enthralled by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"import.  And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,vivisecting others.  Human life--that appeared to him the one thing,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,worth investigating.  Compared to it there was nothing else of any,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,value.  It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of the intellect--to observe where they met, and where they separated,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"at what point they were in unison, and at what point they were at",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,discord--there was a delight in that!  What matter what the cost was?,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,One could never pay too high a price for any sensation.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,He was conscious--and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"brown agate eyes--that it was through certain words of his, musical",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray's soul had turned",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,to this white girl and bowed in worship before her.  To a large extent,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the lad was his own creation.  He had made him premature.  That was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,something.  Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,revealed before the veil was drawn away.  Sometimes this was the effect,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,with the passions and the intellect.  But now and then a complex,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us.  As it,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Experience was of no ethical value.  It was merely the name men gave to,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and showed us what to avoid.  But there was no motive power in,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,experience.  It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"for new experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,passion.  What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous.  It was the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,strongly over us.  Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"""Mother, Mother, I am so happy!"" whispered the girl, burying her face",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dingy sitting-room contained.  ""I am so happy!"" she repeated, ""and you",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"must be happy, too!""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Mrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"daughter's head.  ""Happy!"" she echoed, ""I am only happy, Sibyl, when I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,see you act.  You must not think of anything but your acting.  Mr.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Isaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him money.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The girl looked up and pouted.  ""Money, Mother?"" she cried, ""what does",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"money matter?  Love is more than money.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"get a proper outfit for James.  You must not forget that, Sibyl.  Fifty",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"pounds is a very large sum.  Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"said the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I don't know how we could manage without him,"" answered the elder",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,woman querulously.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Sibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed.  ""We don't want him any more,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Mother.  Prince Charming rules life for us now."" Then she paused.  A",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,rose shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks.  Quick breath parted,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the petals of her lips.  They trembled.  Some southern wind of passion,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"swept over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress.  ""I love",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"him,"" she said simply.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Foolish child! foolish child!"" was the parrot-phrase flung in answer.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,words.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The girl laughed again.  The joy of a caged bird was in her voice.  Her,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"moment, as though to hide their secret.  When they opened, the mist of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,a dream had passed across them.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of common sense.  She did not listen.  She was free in her prison of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"passion.  Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her.  She had called on",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"memory to remake him.  She had sent her soul to search for him, and it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,had brought him back.  His kiss burned again upon her mouth.  Her,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,eyelids were warm with his breath.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery.  This,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"young man might be rich.  If so, marriage should be thought of.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Against the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning.  The,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"arrows of craft shot by her.  She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Suddenly she felt the need to speak.  The wordy silence troubled her.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Mother, Mother,"" she cried, ""why does he love me so much?  I know why",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,I love him.  I love him because he is like what love himself should be.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"But what does he see in me?  I am not worthy of him.  And yet--why, I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"cannot tell--though I feel so much beneath him, I don't feel humble.  I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"feel proud, terribly proud.  Mother, did you love my father as I love",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Prince Charming?""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"cheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain.  Sybil rushed",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her.  ""Forgive me,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Mother.  I know it pains you to talk about our father.  But it only,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,pains you because you loved him so much.  Don't look so sad.  I am as,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,happy to-day as you were twenty years ago.  Ah! let me be happy for,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"ever!""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love.  Besides,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,what do you know of this young man?  You don't even know his name.  The,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"should have shown more consideration.  However, as I said before, if he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"is rich ...""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Ah!  Mother, Mother, let me be happy!""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Mrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"stage-player, clasped her in her arms.  At this moment, the door opened",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room.  He was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"thick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were large and somewhat",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,clumsy in movement.  He was not so finely bred as his sister.  One,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,them.  Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile.  She,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience.  She felt sure,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that the _tableau_ was interesting.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,"" said the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,lad with a good-natured grumble.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Ah! but you don't like being kissed, Jim,"" she cried.  ""You are a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dreadful old bear.""  And she ran across the room and hugged him.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"James Vane looked into his sister's face with tenderness.  ""I want you",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl.  I don't suppose I shall ever",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"see this horrid London again.  I am sure I don't want to.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""My son, don't say such dreadful things,"" murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it.  She",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group.  It would,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Why not, Mother?  I mean it.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""You pain me, my son.  I trust you will return from Australia in a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,position of affluence.  I believe there is no society of any kind in,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the Colonies--nothing that I would call society--so when you have made,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"your fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Society!"" muttered the lad.  ""I don't want to know anything about",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that.  I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"stage.  I hate it.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Oh, Jim!"" said Sibyl, laughing, ""how unkind of you!  But are you",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,really going for a walk with me?  That will be nice!  I was afraid you,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"were going to say good-bye to some of your friends--to Tom Hardy, who",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"gave you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,smoking it.  It is very sweet of you to let me have your last,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"afternoon.  Where shall we go?  Let us go to the park.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I am too shabby,"" he answered, frowning.  ""Only swell people go to the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"park.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Nonsense, Jim,"" she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He hesitated for a moment.  ""Very well,"" he said at last, ""but don't be",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"too long dressing.""  She danced out of the door.  One could hear her",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,singing as she ran upstairs.  Her little feet pattered overhead.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,He walked up and down the room two or three times.  Then he turned to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the still figure in the chair.  ""Mother, are my things ready?"" he asked.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Quite ready, James,"" she answered, keeping her eyes on her work.  For",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,rough stern son of hers.  Her shallow secret nature was troubled when,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,their eyes met.  She used to wonder if he suspected anything.  The,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"silence, for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"She began to complain.  Women defend themselves by attacking, just as",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"they attack by sudden and strange surrenders.  ""I hope you will be",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"contented, James, with your sea-faring life,"" she said.  ""You must",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,remember that it is your own choice.  You might have entered a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"solicitor's office.  Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the country often dine with the best families.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I hate offices, and I hate clerks,"" he replied.  ""But you are quite",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"right.  I have chosen my own life.  All I say is, watch over Sibyl.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Don't let her come to any harm.  Mother, you must watch over her.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""James, you really talk very strangely.  Of course I watch over Sibyl.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"talk to her.  Is that right?  What about that?""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""You are speaking about things you don't understand, James.  In the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,attention.  I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time.  That,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was when acting was really understood.  As for Sibyl, I do not know at",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,present whether her attachment is serious or not.  But there is no,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman.  He is,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"always most polite to me.  Besides, he has the appearance of being",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"rich, and the flowers he sends are lovely.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""You don't know his name, though,"" said the lad harshly.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""No,"" answered his mother with a placid expression in her face.  ""He",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,has not yet revealed his real name.  I think it is quite romantic of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"him.  He is probably a member of the aristocracy.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"James Vane bit his lip.  ""Watch over Sibyl, Mother,"" he cried, ""watch",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"over her.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""My son, you distress me very much.  Sibyl is always under my special",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"care.  Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,she should not contract an alliance with him.  I trust he is one of the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"aristocracy.  He has all the appearance of it, I must say.  It might be",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,a most brilliant marriage for Sibyl.  They would make a charming,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,couple.  His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"them.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,with his coarse fingers.  He had just turned round to say something,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,when the door opened and Sibyl ran in.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""How serious you both are!"" she cried.  ""What is the matter?""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Nothing,"" he answered.  ""I suppose one must be serious sometimes.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o'clock. Everything is",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Good-bye, my son,"" she answered with a bow of strained stateliness.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,there was something in his look that had made her feel afraid.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Kiss me, Mother,"" said the girl.  Her flowerlike lips touched the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,withered cheek and warmed its frost.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""My child! my child!"" cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,search of an imaginary gallery.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Come, Sibyl,"" said her brother impatiently.  He hated his mother's",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,affectations.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"They went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,down the dreary Euston Road.  The passersby glanced in wonder at the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"company of such a graceful, refined-looking girl.  He was like a common",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,gardener walking with a rose.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"some stranger.  He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace.  Sibyl,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"however, was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing.  Her",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,love was trembling in laughter on her lips.  She was thinking of Prince,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Charming, and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"talk of him, but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"sail, about the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked, red-shirted",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"bushrangers.  For he was not to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"whatever he was going to be.  Oh, no!  A sailor's existence was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dreadful.  Fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship, with the hoarse,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a black wind blowing the masts",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands!  He was to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a polite good-bye to the captain,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and go off at once to the gold-fields. Before a week was over he was to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"come across a large nugget of pure gold, the largest nugget that had",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"ever been discovered, and bring it down to the coast in a waggon",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,guarded by six mounted policemen.  The bushrangers were to attack them,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"three times, and be defeated with immense slaughter.  Or, no.  He was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"not to go to the gold-fields at all.  They were horrid places, where",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"men got intoxicated, and shot each other in bar-rooms, and used bad",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"language.  He was to be a nice sheep-farmer, and one evening, as he was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"riding home, he was to see the beautiful heiress being carried off by a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"robber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her.  Of course,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"she would fall in love with him, and he with her, and they would get",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"married, and come home, and live in an immense house in London.  Yes,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,there were delightful things in store for him.  But he must be very,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money foolishly.  She was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"only a year older than he was, but she knew so much more of life.  He",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and to say his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"prayers each night before he went to sleep.  God was very good, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"would watch over him.  She would pray for him, too, and in a few years",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,he would come back quite rich and happy.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer.  He was heart-sick,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,at leaving home.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of Sibyl's position.  This young dandy who was making love to her could,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"mean her no good.  He was a gentleman, and he hated him for that, hated",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"him through some curious race-instinct for which he could not account,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him.  He was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother's nature,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl's happiness.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,them; sometimes they forgive them.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"His mother!  He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,he had brooded on for many months of silence.  A chance phrase that he,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his ears",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"one night as he waited at the stage-door, had set loose a train of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,horrible thoughts.  He remembered it as if it had been the lash of a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,hunting-crop across his face.  His brows knit together into a wedge-like,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"furrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,"" cried Sibyl, ""and I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"am making the most delightful plans for your future.  Do say something.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""What do you want me to say?""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,"" she answered,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,smiling at him.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He shrugged his shoulders.  ""You are more likely to forget me than I am",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to forget you, Sibyl.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"She flushed.  ""What do you mean, Jim?"" she asked.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""You have a new friend, I hear.  Who is he?  Why have you not told me",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"about him?  He means you no good.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Stop, Jim!"" she exclaimed.  ""You must not say anything against him.  I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"love him.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Why, you don't even know his name,"" answered the lad.  ""Who is he?  I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"have a right to know.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""He is called Prince Charming.  Don't you like the name.  Oh! you silly",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"boy! you should never forget it.  If you only saw him, you would think",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,him the most wonderful person in the world.  Some day you will meet,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,him--when you come back from Australia.  You will like him so much.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Everybody likes him, and I ... love him.  I wish you could come to the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Oh! how I shall play it!  Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet!",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,To have him sitting there!  To play for his delight!  I am afraid I may,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"frighten the company, frighten or enthrall them.  To be in love is to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,surpass one's self.  Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting 'genius',The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,to his loafers at the bar.  He has preached me as a dogma; to-night he,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"will announce me as a revelation.  I feel it.  And it is all his, his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"only, Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces.  But I am",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,poor beside him.  Poor?  What does that matter?  When poverty creeps in,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"at the door, love flies in through the window.  Our proverbs want",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"rewriting.  They were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring-time",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"for me, I think, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,over the side.  They talked to each other across the theatre and shared,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them.  Some women,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Horribly!"" he answered, gazing at her in amazement.  ""Horribly!  It",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"""Dorian, Dorian,"" she cried, ""before I knew you, acting was the one",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,reality of my life.  It was only in the theatre that I lived.  I,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,thought that it was all true.  I was Rosalind one night and Portia the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"other.  The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,were mine also.  I believed in everything.  The common people who acted,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,with me seemed to me to be godlike.  The painted scenes were my world.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them real.  You came--oh, my",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,beautiful love!--and you freed my soul from prison.  You taught me what,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"reality really is.  To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"through the hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"which I had always played.  To-night, for the first time, I became",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"conscious that the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"moonlight in the orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"that the words I had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"what I wanted to say.  You had brought me something higher, something",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of which all art is but a reflection.  You had made me understand what,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,love really is.  My love!  My love!  Prince Charming!  Prince of life!,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,I have grown sick of shadows.  You are more to me than all art can ever,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,be.  What have I to do with the puppets of a play?  When I came on,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to-night, I could not understand how it was that everything had gone",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,from me.  I thought that I was going to be wonderful.  I found that I,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,could do nothing.  Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The knowledge was exquisite to me.  I heard them hissing, and I smiled.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"What could they know of love such as ours?  Take me away, Dorian--take",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"might mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot mimic one that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"burns me like fire.  Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you understand now what it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"signifies?  Even if I could do it, it would be profanation for me to",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"across to him, and with her little fingers stroked his hair.  She knelt",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"down and pressed his hands to her lips.  He drew them away, and a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,shudder ran through him.,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"She rose from her knees and, with a piteous expression of pain in her",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"face, came across the room to him.  She put her hand upon his arm and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"looked into his eyes.  He thrust her back.  ""Don't touch me!"" he cried.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet and lay",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"whispered.  ""I am so sorry I didn't act well.  I was thinking of you",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"all the time.  But I will try--indeed, I will try.  It came so suddenly",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"across me, my love for you.  I think I should never have known it if",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"you had not kissed me--if we had not kissed each other.  Kiss me again,",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,away from me.  My brother ... No; never mind.  He didn't mean it.  He,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was in jest.... But you, oh! can't you forgive me for to-night? I will",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"work so hard and try to improve.  Don't be cruel to me, because I love",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"you better than anything in the world.  After all, it is only once that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"I have not pleased you.  But you are quite right, Dorian.  I should",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"have shown myself more of an artist.  It was foolish of me, and yet I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"couldn't help it.  Oh, don't leave me, don't leave me."" A fit of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,passionate sobbing choked her.  She crouched on the floor like a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"wounded thing, and Dorian Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"her, and his chiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain.  There is",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,ceased to love.  Sibyl Vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic.,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer.  Her little",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him.  He",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,turned on his heel and left the room.  In a few moments he was out of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the theatre.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Where he went to he hardly knew.  He remembered wandering through dimly,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"lit streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,houses.  Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"him.  Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,like monstrous apes.  He had seen grotesque children huddled upon,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"door-steps, and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"As the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,itself into a perfect pearl.  Huge carts filled with nodding lilies,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,rumbled slowly down the polished empty street.  The air was heavy with,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,anodyne for his pain.  He followed into the market and watched the men,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,unloading their waggons.  A white-smocked carter offered him some,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"cherries.  He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"for them, and began to eat them listlessly.  They had been plucked at",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them.  A long",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"jade-green piles of vegetables.  Under the portico, with its grey,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,waiting for the auction to be over.  Others crowded round the swinging,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,doors of the coffee-house in the piazza.  The heavy cart-horses slipped,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks.  Iris-necked,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"After a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home.  For a few",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"square, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,silver against it.  From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was rising.  It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge's barge, that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire.  He turned them out and,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,decorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal.  As,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the portrait",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Basil Hallward had painted of him.  He started back as if in surprise.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled.  After he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"had taken the button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Finally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it.  In",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed.  The",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,expression looked different.  One would have said that there was a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,touch of cruelty in the mouth.  It was certainly strange.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind.  The",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"corners, where they lay shuddering.  But the strange expression that he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,more intensified even.  The quivering ardent sunlight showed him the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Cupids, one of Lord Henry's many presents to him, glanced hurriedly",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,into its polished depths.  No line like that warped his red lips.  What,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,did it mean?,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,again.  There were no signs of any change when he looked into the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"actual painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,had altered.  It was not a mere fancy of his own.  The thing was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,horribly apparent.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,He threw himself into a chair and began to think.  Suddenly there,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward's studio the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"day the picture had been finished.  Yes, he remembered it perfectly.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of his then just conscious boyhood.  Surely his wish had not been,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,fulfilled?  Such things were impossible.  It seemed monstrous even to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"think of them.  And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,touch of cruelty in the mouth.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Cruelty!  Had he been cruel?  It was the girl's fault, not his.  He had",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,had thought her great.  Then she had disappointed him.  She had been,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"shallow and unworthy.  And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,child.  He remembered with what callousness he had watched her.  Why,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,had he been made like that?  Why had such a soul been given to him?,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,But he had suffered also.  During the three terrible hours that the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"play had lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,torture.  His life was well worth hers.  She had marred him for a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"moment, if he had wounded her for an age.  Besides, women were better",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,suited to bear sorrow than men.  They lived on their emotions.  They,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"only thought of their emotions.  When they took lovers, it was merely",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,to have some one with whom they could have scenes.  Lord Henry had told,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"him that, and Lord Henry knew what women were.  Why should he trouble",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,about Sibyl Vane?  She was nothing to him now.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,But the picture?  What was he to say of that?  It held the secret of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"his life, and told his story.  It had taught him to love his own",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,beauty.  Would it teach him to loathe his own soul?  Would he ever look,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,at it again?,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses.  The,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,makes men mad.  The picture had not changed.  It was folly to think so.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,smile.  Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight.  Its blue eyes,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"met his own.  A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"painted image of himself, came over him.  It had altered already, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,would alter more.  Its gold would wither into grey.  Its red and white,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"roses would die.  For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and wreck its fairness.  But he would not sin.  The picture, changed or",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience.  He would",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"resist temptation.  He would not see Lord Henry any more--would not, at",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Hallward's garden had first stirred within him the passion for,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"impossible things.  He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"marry her, try to love her again.  Yes, it was his duty to do so.  She",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,must have suffered more than he had.  Poor child!  He had been selfish,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and cruel to her.  The fascination that she had exercised over him,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,would return.  They would be happy together.  His life with her would,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,be beautiful and pure.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,He got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it.  ""How horrible!"" he murmured",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it.  When he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath.  The fresh morning",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions.  He thought only of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Sibyl.  A faint echo of his love came back to him.  He repeated her,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,name over and over again.  The birds that were singing in the,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"hand that morning.  He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The others he opened listlessly.  They contained the usual collection,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,young men every morning during the season.  There was a rather heavy,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"had the courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,old-fashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,unnecessary things are our only necessities; and there were several,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,very courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,offering to advance any sum of money at a moment's notice and at the,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"After about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,simply his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,there had been a look of joy?  Surely a painted canvas could not alter?,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The thing was absurd.  It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,It would make him smile.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing!  First in",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,cruelty round the warped lips.  He almost dreaded his valet leaving the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,room.  He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,portrait.  He was afraid of certainty.  When the coffee and cigarettes,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"tell him to remain.  As the door was closing behind him, he called him",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,back.  The man stood waiting for his orders.  Dorian looked at him for,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"a moment.  ""I am not at home to any one, Victor,"" he said with a sigh.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The man bowed and retired.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen.  The screen,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern.  He scanned it curiously,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man's life.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Should he move it aside, after all?  Why not let it stay there?  What",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible.  If it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was not true, why trouble about it?  But what if, by some fate or",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"deadlier chance, eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,change?  What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,his own picture?  Basil would be sure to do that.  No; the thing had to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"be examined, and at once.  Anything would be better than this dreadful",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,state of doubt.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,He got up and locked both doors.  At least he would be alone when he,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,looked upon the mask of his shame.  Then he drew the screen aside and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,saw himself face to face.  It was perfectly true.  The portrait had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,altered.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,scientific interest.  That such a change should have taken place was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,incredible to him.  And yet it was a fact.  Was there some subtle,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him?  Could it be,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"that what that soul thought, they realized?--that what it dreamed, they",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"made true?  Or was there some other, more terrible reason?  He",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,gazing at the picture in sickened horror.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him.  It had made him",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane.  It was not",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,too late to make reparation for that.  She could still be his wife.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"His unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"be transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"fear of God to us all.  There were opiates for remorse, drugs that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,could lull the moral sense to sleep.  But here was a visible symbol of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the degradation of sin.  Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,brought upon their souls.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Three o'clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir.  He was trying to gather up the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"wandering.  He did not know what to do, or what to think.  Finally, he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"loved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness.  He",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"pain.  There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"feel that no one else has a right to blame us.  It is the confession,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"not the priest, that gives us absolution.  When Dorian had finished the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry's",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of style.  They affect us just as vulgarity affects us.  They give us,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"beauty crosses our lives.  If these elements of beauty are real, the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect.  Suddenly,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"play.  Or rather we are both.  We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of the spectacle enthralls us.  In the present case, what is it that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,has really happened?  Some one has killed herself for love of you.  I,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,wish that I had ever had such an experience.  It would have made me in,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,love with love for the rest of my life.  The people who have adored,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,buried my romance in a bed of asphodel.  She dragged it out again and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,assured me that I had spoiled her life.  I am bound to state that she,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"ate an enormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety.  But what a lack",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of taste she showed!  The one charm of the past is that it is the past.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,But women never know when the curtain has fallen.  They always want a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"sixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"they propose to continue it.  If they were allowed their own way, every",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"comedy would have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"a farce.  They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,is fond of pink ribbons.  It always means that they have a history.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"consoles some.  Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"woman once told me, and I can quite understand it.  Besides, nothing",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner.  Conscience makes,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"unchanged.  And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dead and inorganic things?  Nay, without thought or conscious desire,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,alter.  That was all.  Why inquire too closely into it?,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,For there would be a real pleasure in watching it.  He would be able to,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""No,"" said Dorian Gray, ""there is nothing fearful about it.  It is one",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of the great romantic tragedies of the age.  As a rule, people who act",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"lead the most commonplace lives.  They are good husbands, or faithful",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"wives, or something tedious.  You know what I mean--middle-class virtue",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and all that kind of thing.  How different Sibyl was!  She lived her,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,finest tragedy.  She was always a heroine.  The last night she,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,played--the night you saw her--she acted badly because she had known,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the reality of love.  When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,might have died.  She passed again into the sphere of art.  There is,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,something of the martyr about her.  Her death has all the pathetic,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty.  But, as I was saying,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,you must not think I have not suffered.  If you had come in yesterday,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"at a particular moment--about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"six--you would have found me in tears.  Even Harry, who was here, who",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through.  I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,suffered immensely.  Then it passed away.  I cannot repeat an emotion.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"No one can, except sentimentalists.  And you are awfully unjust, Basil.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,You come down here to console me.  That is charming of you.  You find,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"me consoled, and you are furious.  How like a sympathetic person!  You",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"redressed, or some unjust law altered--I forget exactly what it was.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment.  He",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"confirmed misanthrope.  And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,see it from a proper artistic point of view.  Was it not Gautier who,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,used to write about _la consolation des arts_?  I remember picking up a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"delightful phrase.  Well, I am not like that young man you told me of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"when we were down at Marlow together, the young man who used to say",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life.  I,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"love beautiful things that one can touch and handle.  Old brocades,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"luxury, pomp--there is much to be got from all these.  But the artistic",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"me.  To become the spectator of one's own life, as Harry says, is to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,escape the suffering of life.  I know you are surprised at my talking,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,to you like this.  You have not realized how I have developed.  I was a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"schoolboy when you knew me.  I am a man now.  I have new passions, new",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"thoughts, new ideas.  I am different, but you must not like me less.  I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"am changed, but you must always be my friend.  Of course, I am very",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"""I see you did.  Don't speak.  Wait till you hear what I have to say.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"extraordinary influence over me.  I was dominated, soul, brain, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"power, by you.  You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream.  I,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,worshipped you.  I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke.  I,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,wanted to have you all to myself.  I was only happy when I was with,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"you.  When you were away from me, you were still present in my art....",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Of course, I never let you know anything about this.  It would have",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,been impossible.  You would not have understood it.  I hardly,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,understood it myself.  I only knew that I had seen perfection face to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"face, and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes--too",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"wonderful, perhaps, for in such mad worships there is peril, the peril",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of losing them, no less than the peril of keeping them....  Weeks and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"weeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in you.  Then came a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"new development.  I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour, and as",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Adonis with huntsman's cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned with,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian's barge, gazing",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,across the green turbid Nile.  You had leaned over the still pool of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,some Greek woodland and seen in the water's silent silver the marvel of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"your own face.  And it had all been what art should be--unconscious,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"ideal, and remote.  One day, a fatal day I sometimes think, I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own dress and in your own",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"time.  Whether it was the realism of the method, or the mere wonder of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"your own personality, thus directly presented to me without mist or",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"veil, I cannot tell.  But I know that as I worked at it, every flake",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret.  I grew afraid,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"that others would know of my idolatry.  I felt, Dorian, that I had told",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"too much, that I had put too much of myself into it.  Then it was that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited.  You were a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me.  But I did not mind",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"that.  When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I felt",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my studio,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely good-looking",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and that I could paint.  Even now I cannot help feeling that it is a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,shown in the work one creates.  Art is always more abstract than we,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,fancy.  Form and colour tell us of form and colour--that is all.  It,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"it ever reveals him.  And so when I got this offer from Paris, I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,It never occurred to me that you would refuse.  I see now that you were,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"right.  The picture cannot be shown.  You must not be angry with me,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Dorian, for what I have told you.  As I said to Harry, once, you are",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"made to be worshipped.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,for the time.  Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"painter who had just made this strange confession to him, and wondered",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"was unchanged, and yet his loathing of it was intensified.  Gold hair,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"blue eyes, and rose-red lips--they all were there.  It was simply the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,expression that had altered.  That was horrible in its cruelty.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Compared to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow Basil's",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!--how shallow, and of what little",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,account!  His own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"calling him to judgement.  A look of pain came across him, and he flung",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the rich pall over the picture.  As he did so, a knock came to the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,door.  He passed out as his servant entered.,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"something sly about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Sitting down at the writing-table he scribbled a note to Lord Henry,",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"artists who dealt with him.  As a rule, he never left his shop.  He",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,waited for people to come to him.  But he always made an exception in,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,favour of Dorian Gray.  There was something about Dorian that charmed,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,everybody.  It was a pleasure even to see him.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?"" he said, rubbing his fat freckled",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"hands.  ""I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"going upstairs.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman's spirited dislike",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his hand to it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,so as to help them.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Something of a load to carry, sir,"" gasped the little man when they",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I am afraid it is rather heavy,"" murmured Dorian as he unlocked the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He had not entered the place for more than four years--not, indeed,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"since he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child, and then",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"as a study when he grew somewhat older.  It was a large,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his strange likeness",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to his mother, and also for other reasons, he had always hated and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,desired to keep at a distance.  It appeared to Dorian to have but,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"little changed.  There was the huge Italian _cassone_, with its",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"fantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,he had so often hidden himself as a boy.  There the satinwood book-case,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,filled with his dog-eared schoolbooks.  On the wall behind it was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,hanging the same ragged Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"were playing chess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists.  How well he,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,remembered it all!  Every moment of his lonely childhood came back to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,him as he looked round.  He recalled the stainless purity of his boyish,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"life, and it seemed horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was to be hidden away.  How little he had thought, in those dead days,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of all that was in store for him!,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"this.  He had the key, and no one else could enter it.  Beneath its",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and unclean.  What did it matter?  No one could see it.  He himself,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,would not see it.  Why should he watch the hideous corruption of his,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"soul?  He kept his youth--that was enough.  And, besides, might not",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"his nature grow finer, after all?  There was no reason that the future",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"should be so full of shame.  Some love might come across his life, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"purify him, and shield him from those sins that seemed to be already",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,stirring in spirit and in flesh--those curious unpictured sins whose,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"very mystery lent them their subtlety and their charm.  Perhaps, some",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"day, the cruel look would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"mouth, and he might show to the world Basil Hallward's masterpiece.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"No; that was impossible.  Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,upon the canvas was growing old.  It might escape the hideousness of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"sin, but the hideousness of age was in store for it.  The cheeks would",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,become hollow or flaccid.  Yellow crow's feet would creep round the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,fading eyes and make them horrible.  The hair would lose its,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"brightness, the mouth would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"as the mouths of old men are.  There would be the wrinkled throat, the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"cold, blue-veined hands, the twisted body, that he remembered in the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,grandfather who had been so stern to him in his boyhood.  The picture,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,had to be concealed.  There was no help for it.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please,"" he said, wearily, turning round.",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"""Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,"" answered the frame-maker, who",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was still gasping for breath.  ""Where shall we put it, sir?""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Oh, anywhere.  Here:  this will do.  I don't want to have it hung up.",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,keeping his eye on the man.  He felt ready to leap upon him and fling,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"concealed the secret of his life.  ""I shan't trouble you any more now.",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"sir."" And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,uncomely face.  He had never seen any one so marvellous.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and put the key in his pocket.  He felt safe now.  No one would ever,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,look upon the horrible thing.  No eye but his would ever see his shame.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"On reaching the library, he found that it was just after five o'clock",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and that the tea had been already brought up.  On a little table of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Radley, his guardian's wife, a pretty professional invalid who had",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"spent the preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and beside it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and the edges soiled.  A copy of the third edition of _The St. James's,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Gazette_ had been placed on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,returned.  He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He would be sure to miss the picture--had no doubt missed it already,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,while he had been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been set,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"back, and a blank space was visible on the wall.  Perhaps some night he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,room.  It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one's house.  He had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,or a shred of crumpled lace.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henry's",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"note.  It was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and a book that might interest him, and that he would be at the club at",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"eight-fifteen. He opened _The St. James's_ languidly, and looked through",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,it.  A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye.  It drew,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,attention to the following paragraph:,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,flung the pieces away.  How ugly it all was!  And how horribly real,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,ugliness made things!  He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,having sent him the report.  And it was certainly stupid of him to have,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,marked it with red pencil.  Victor might have read it.  The man knew,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,more than enough English for that.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something.  And, yet,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,what did it matter?  What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane's,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,death?  There was nothing to fear.  Dorian Gray had not killed her.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him.  What was,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and taking up the volume, flung",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,himself into an arm-chair and began to turn over the leaves.  After a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,few minutes he became absorbed.  It was the strangest book that he had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"ever read.  It seemed to him that in exquisite raiment, and to the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,show before him.  Things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,made real to him.  Things of which he had never dreamed were gradually,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,revealed.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"It was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin.  The,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and obscure at once, full of _argot_ and of archaisms, of technical",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of some of the finest artists of the French school of _Symbolistes_.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,colour.  The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,philosophy.  One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,spiritual ecstasies of some mediaeval saint or the morbid confessions,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of a modern sinner.  It was a poisonous book.  The heavy odour of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain.  The,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"mere cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter,",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,sought to free himself from it.  He procured from Paris no less than,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"almost entirely lost control.  The hero, the wonderful young Parisian",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself.  And,",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"life, written before he had lived it.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,In one point he was more fortunate than the novel's fantastic hero.  He,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"grotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"water which came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"occasioned by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,been so remarkable.  It was with an almost cruel joy--and perhaps in,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"nearly every joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"place--that he used to read the latter part of the book, with its",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"really tragic, if somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"despair of one who had himself lost what in others, and the world, he",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,Dorian Gray entered the room.  There was something in the purity of his,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,memory of the innocence that they had tarnished.  They wondered how one,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art.  His little,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver.  Indeed, there were many,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to ""make",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,cane.  He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,dominant characteristic.  As he looked back upon man moving through,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"history, he was haunted by a feeling of loss.  So much had been",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,surrendered! and to such little purpose!  There had been mad wilful,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance,",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,that was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival.  It was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to have its service of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"mode of passionate experience.  Its aim, indeed, was to be experience",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"be.  Of the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing.  But it was to",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions,",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood.,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria.  In the mystic offices to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"which such things were put, there was something that quickened his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,imagination.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,to be almost too great to be borne.  Upon the walls of the lonely,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"purple-and-gold pall as a curtain.  For weeks he would not go there,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,until he was driven away.  On his return he would sit in front of the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"times, with that pride of individualism that is half the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"fascination of sin, and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his own.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,than once spent the winter.  He hated to be separated from the picture,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing.  It was true,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,from that?  He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him.  He had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,not painted it.  What was it to him how vile and full of shame it,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"looked?  Even if he told them, would they believe it?",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Yet he was afraid.  Sometimes when he was down at his great house in,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,been tampered with and that the picture was still there.  What if it,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,should be stolen?  The mere thought made him cold with horror.  Surely,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the world would know his secret then.  Perhaps the world already,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,suspected it.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out.  Curious stories,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,became current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year.  It,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade.  His,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,they were determined to discover his secret.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"him.  It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him.  Women who had",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,strange and dangerous charm.  His great wealth was a certain element of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"security.  Society--civilized society, at least--is never very ready to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,fascinating.  It feels instinctively that manners are of more,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"importance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"is of much less value than the possession of a good _chef_.  And, after",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"life.  Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrees_, as",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,possibly a good deal to be said for his view.  For the canons of good,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art.  Form is",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"absolutely essential to it.  It should have the dignity of a ceremony,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,to us.  Is insincerity such a terrible thing?  I think not.  It is,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray's opinion.  He used to wonder at the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence.  To him, man was a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of the dead.  He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"blood flowed in his veins.  Here was Philip Herbert, described by",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"King James, as one who was ""caressed by the Court for his handsome",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"face, which kept him not long company.""  Was it young Herbert's life",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that he sometimes led?  Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,to body till it had reached his own?  Was it some dim sense of that,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"give utterance, in Basil Hallward's studio, to the mad prayer that had",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"so changed his life?  Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,with his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet.  What had this,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,man's legacy been?  Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,some inheritance of sin and shame?  Were his own actions merely the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize?  Here, from the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves.  A flower was in her right hand,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses.  On,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple.  There were large,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"green rosettes upon her little pointed shoes.  He knew her life, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the strange stories that were told about her lovers.  Had he something,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of her temperament in him?  These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"look curiously at him.  What of George Willoughby, with his powdered",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,hair and fantastic patches?  How evil he looked!  The face was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,disdain.  Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,were so overladen with rings.  He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"century, and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars.  What of the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"second Lord Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Fitzherbert?  How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and insolent pose!  What passions had he bequeathed?  The world had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,looked upon him as infamous.  He had led the orgies at Carlton House.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The star of the Garter glittered upon his breast.  Beside him hung the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"portrait of his wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black.  Her blood,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"also, stirred within him.  How curious it all seemed!  And his mother",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"with her Lady Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips--he knew",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"what he had got from her.  He had got from her his beauty, and his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,passion for the beauty of others.  She laughed at him in her loose,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Bacchante dress.  There were vine leaves in her hair.  The purple,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,spilled from the cup she was holding.  The carnations of the painting,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"had withered, but the eyes were still wonderful in their depth and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,brilliancy of colour.  They seemed to follow him wherever he went.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one's own race,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious.  There,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,had been in his brain and in his passions.  He felt that he had known,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,subtlety.  It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible _taedium vitae_, that comes",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,his grey ulster turned up.  He had a bag in his hand.  Dorian,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"recognized him.  It was Basil Hallward.  A strange sense of fear, for",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"which he could not account, came over him.  He made no sign of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,recognition and went on quickly in the direction of his own house.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,But Hallward had seen him.  Dorian heard him first stopping on the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"pavement and then hurrying after him.  In a few moments, his hand was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,on his arm.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Dorian!  What an extraordinary piece of luck!  I have been waiting for",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,you in your library ever since nine o'clock. Finally I took pity on,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out.  I am",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"you before I left.  I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"you passed me.  But I wasn't quite sure.  Didn't you recognize me?""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""In this fog, my dear Basil?  Why, I can't even recognize Grosvenor",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,talk.  Here we are at your door.  Let me come in for a moment.  I have,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"something to say to you.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"till twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven.  In fact, I was on my",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"way to the club to look for you, when I met you.  You see, I shan't",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"have any delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things.  All I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"have with me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"minutes.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Dorian looked at him and smiled.  ""What a way for a fashionable painter",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to travel!  A Gladstone bag and an ulster!  Come in, or the fog will",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,get into the house.  And mind you don't talk about anything serious.,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"hearth.  The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"stood, with some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"""You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian.  He gave me",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"everything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes.  He is",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"of the French, doesn't it?  But--do you know?--he was not at all a bad",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"servant.  I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain about.  One",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,often imagines things that are quite absurd.  He was really very,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,devoted to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away.  Have another,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"of myself to-night. I should like to be somebody else.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""They must interest you, Dorian.  Every gentleman is interested in his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,good name.  You don't want people to talk of you as something vile and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"degraded.  Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that kind of thing.  But position and wealth are not everything.  Mind,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"you, I don't believe these rumours at all.  At least, I can't believe",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,them when I see you.  Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man's,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,face.  It cannot be concealed.  People talk sometimes of secret vices.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"There are no such things.  If a wretched man has a vice, it shows",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"itself in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"moulding of his hands even.  Somebody--I won't mention his name, but",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,you know him--came to me last year to have his portrait done.  I had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"never seen him before, and had never heard anything about him at the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"time, though I have heard a good deal since.  He offered an extravagant",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,price.  I refused him.  There was something in the shape of his fingers,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that I hated.  I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"about him.  His life is dreadful.  But you, Dorian, with your pure,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"bright, innocent face, and your marvellous untroubled youth--I can't",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"believe anything against you.  And yet I see you very seldom, and you",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"never come down to the studio now, and when I am away from you, and I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"hear all these hideous things that people are whispering about you, I",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"don't know what to say.  Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it?  Why is it that so,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,many gentlemen in London will neither go to your house or invite you to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,theirs?  You used to be a friend of Lord Staveley.  I met him at dinner,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"last week.  Your name happened to come up in conversation, in",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Dudley.  Staveley curled his lip and said that you might have the most,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"artistic tastes, but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"should be allowed to know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"same room with.  I reminded him that I was a friend of yours, and asked",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,him what he meant.  He told me.  He told me right out before everybody.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,It was horrible!  Why is your friendship so fatal to young men?  There,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,was that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide.  You were,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"his great friend.  There was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,with a tarnished name.  You and he were inseparable.  What about Adrian,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Singleton and his dreadful end?  What about Lord Kent's only son and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,his career?  I met his father yesterday in St. James's Street.  He,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,seemed broken with shame and sorrow.  What about the young Duke of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Perth?  What sort of life has he got now?  What gentleman would,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"associate with him?""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Stop, Basil.  You are talking about things of which you know nothing,""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"said Dorian Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of infinite contempt",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"in his voice.  ""You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"It is because I know everything about his life, not because he knows",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"anything about mine.  With such blood as he has in his veins, how could",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,his record be clean?  You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Did I teach the one his vices, and the other his debauchery?  If Kent's",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"Adrian Singleton writes his friend's name across a bill, am I his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,keeper?  I know how people chatter in England.  The middle classes air,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"their moral prejudices over their gross dinner-tables, and whisper",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the people they slander.  In this country, it is enough for a man to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Dorian,"" cried Hallward, ""that is not the question.  England is bad",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,why I want you to be fine.  You have not been fine.  One has a right to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,judge of a man by the effect he has over his friends.  Yours seem to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"lose all sense of honour, of goodness, of purity.  You have filled them",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,with a madness for pleasure.  They have gone down into the depths.  You,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"led them there.  Yes:  you led them there, and yet you can smile, as",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,you are smiling now.  And there is worse behind.  I know you and Harry,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"are inseparable.  Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"not have made his sister's name a by-word.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Take care, Basil.  You go too far.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I must speak, and you must listen.  You shall listen.  When you met",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Lady Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her.  Is there",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,a single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"park?  Why, even her children are not allowed to live with her.  Then",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,there are other stories--stories that you have been seen creeping at,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,dawn out of dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,dens in London.  Are they true?  Can they be true?  When I first heard,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"them, I laughed.  I hear them now, and they make me shudder.  What",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"about your country-house and the life that is led there?  Dorian, you",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,don't know what is said about you.  I won't tell you that I don't want,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,to preach to you.  I remember Harry saying once that every man who,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,turned himself into an amateur curate for the moment always began by,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"saying that, and then proceeded to break his word.  I do want to preach",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,to you.  I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,you.  I want you to have a clean name and a fair record.  I want you to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,get rid of the dreadful people you associate with.  Don't shrug your,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,shoulders like that.  Don't be so indifferent.  You have a wonderful,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"influence.  Let it be for good, not for evil.  They say that you",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"corrupt every one with whom you become intimate, and that it is quite",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,sufficient for you to enter a house for shame of some kind to follow,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,after.  I don't know whether it is so or not.  How should I know?  But,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,it is said of you.  I am told things that it seems impossible to doubt.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Lord Gloucester was one of my greatest friends at Oxford.  He showed me,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,a letter that his wife had written to him when she was dying alone in,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,confession I ever read.  I told him that it was absurd--that I knew you,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,thoroughly and that you were incapable of anything of the kind.  Know,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"and held it to the picture.  In the left-hand corner was his own name,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,traced in long letters of bright vermilion.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire.  He had never",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"done that.  Still, it was his own picture.  He knew it, and he felt as",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,if his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice.  His,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,own picture!  What did it mean?  Why had it altered?  He turned and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man.  His mouth twitched,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate.  He passed his hand,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,across his forehead.  It was dank with clammy sweat.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting.  There was neither,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,real sorrow in it nor real joy.  There was simply the passion of the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes.  He had taken",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do so.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""What does this mean?"" cried Hallward, at last.  His own voice sounded",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,shrill and curious in his ears.,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"to be!"" He held the light up again to the canvas and examined it.  The",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,lay there sputtering.  He placed his foot on it and put it out.  Then,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,he flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and buried his face in his hands.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Good God, Dorian, what a lesson!  What an awful lesson!"" There was no",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window.  ""Pray,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Dorian, pray,"" he murmured.  ""What is it that one was taught to say in",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""It is never too late, Dorian.  Let us kneel down and try if we cannot",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him, as though it had",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"been suggested to him by the image on the canvas, whispered into his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,ear by those grinning lips.  The mad passions of a hunted animal,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"stirred within him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the table,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,more than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything.  He glanced,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,wildly around.  Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that faced him.  His eye fell on it.  He knew what it was.  It was a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"knife that he had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and had forgotten to take away with him.  He moved slowly towards it,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"passing Hallward as he did so.  As soon as he got behind him, he seized",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,it and turned round.  Hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,to rise.  He rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"is behind the ear, crushing the man's head down on the table and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,stabbing again and again.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,There was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"with blood.  Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"waving grotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air.  He stabbed him",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"twice more, but the man did not move.  Something began to trickle on",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the floor.  He waited for a moment, still pressing the head down.  Then",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"he threw the knife on the table, and listened.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet.  He",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,opened the door and went out on the landing.  The house was absolutely,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,quiet.  No one was about.  For a few seconds he stood bending over the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Then he took out the key and returned to the room, locking himself in",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,as he did so.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms.  Had it not been",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"slowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,simply asleep.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"How quickly it had all been done!  He felt strangely calm, and walking",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony.  The wind",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock's",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes.  He looked down and saw the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,policeman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the doors of the silent houses.  The crimson spot of a prowling hansom,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,gleamed at the corner and then vanished.  A woman in a fluttering shawl,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she went.  Now and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"then she stopped and peered back.  Once, she began to sing in a hoarse",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,voice.  The policeman strolled over and said something to her.  She,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"stumbled away, laughing.  A bitter blast swept across the square.  The",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"gas-lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"black iron branches to and fro.  He shivered and went back, closing the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,window behind him.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Having reached the door, he turned the key and opened it.  He did not",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,even glance at the murdered man.  He felt that the secret of the whole,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,thing was not to realize the situation.  The friend who had painted the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,life.  That was enough.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Then he remembered the lamp.  It was a rather curious one of Moorish,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"steel, and studded with coarse turquoises.  Perhaps it might be missed",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"by his servant, and questions would be asked.  He hesitated for a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"moment, then he turned back and took it from the table.  He could not",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,help seeing the dead thing.  How still it was!  How horribly white the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,long hands looked!  It was like a dreadful wax image.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Having locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs.  The",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain.  He stopped,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,several times and waited.  No:  everything was still.  It was merely,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the sound of his own footsteps.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,They must be hidden away somewhere.  He unlocked a secret press that,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was in the wainscoting, a press in which he kept his own curious",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"disguises, and put them into it.  He could easily burn them afterwards.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Then he pulled out his watch.  It was twenty minutes to two.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He sat down and began to think.  Every year--every month, almost--men",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,were strangled in England for what he had done.  There had been a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,madness of murder in the air.  Some red star had come too close to the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"earth.... And yet, what evidence was there against him?  Basil Hallward",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,had left the house at eleven.  No one had seen him come in again.  Most,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of the servants were at Selby Royal.  His valet had gone to bed....,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Paris!  Yes.  It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"train, as he had intended.  With his curious reserved habits, it would",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,be months before any suspicions would be roused.  Months!  Everything,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,could be destroyed long before then.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,A sudden thought struck him.  He put on his fur coat and hat and went,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"out into the hall.  There he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,bull's-eye reflected in the window.  He waited and held his breath.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"After a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the door very gently behind him.  Then he began ringing the bell.  In,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"about five minutes his valet appeared, half-dressed and looking very",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,drowsy.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,"" he said, stepping in;",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?""",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,blinking.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Ten minutes past two?  How horribly late!  You must wake me at nine",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,biting his lip and thinking.  Then he took down the Blue Book from one,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,At nine o'clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters.  Dorian was sleeping quite,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"cheek.  He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,chocolate.  The mellow November sun came streaming into the room.  The,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,almost like a morning in May.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,blood-stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,with terrible distinctness.  He winced at the memory of all that he had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"back to him, and he grew cold with passion.  The dead man was still",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now.  How horrible that was!",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,or grow mad.  There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,senses.  But this was not one of them.  It was a thing to be driven out,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,scarf-pin and changing his rings more than once.  He spent a long time,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"mad delightful follies.  There was romance in every place.  But Venice,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"romantic, background was everything, or almost everything.  Basil had",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret.  Poor",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget.  He read",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned merchants,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each other; he,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps tears of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by the hot,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red ibises, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small beryl eyes",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood over those,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell of that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the ""_monstre",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"charmant_"" that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.  But after a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"time the book fell from his hand.  He grew nervous, and a horrible fit",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of terror came over him.  What if Alan Campbell should be out of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,England?  Days would elapse before he could come back.  Perhaps he,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,might refuse to come.  What could he do then?  Every moment was of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,vital importance.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"They had been great friends once, five years before--almost",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"inseparable, indeed.  Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"When they met in society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled:  Alan",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Campbell never did.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian.  His,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,dominant intellectual passion was for science.  At Cambridge he had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year.  Indeed, he was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"own in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"prescriptions.  He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs.  In,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"fact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,together--music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"be able to exercise whenever he wished--and, indeed, exercised often",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,without being conscious of it.  They had met at Lady Berkshire's the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on.  For,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,eighteen months their intimacy lasted.  Campbell was always either at,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square.  To him, as to many others, Dorian",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,life.  Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,ever knew.  But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,they met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"party at which Dorian Gray was present.  He had changed, too--was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"strangely melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"music, and would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"called upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,left in which to practise.  And this was certainly true.  Every day he,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"seemed to become more interested in biology, and his name appeared once",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,or twice in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,curious experiments.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for.  Every second he kept,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,glancing at the clock.  As the minutes went by he became horribly,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"agitated.  At last he got up and began to pace up and down the room,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,looking like a beautiful caged thing.  He took long stealthy strides.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,His hands were curiously cold.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The suspense became unbearable.  Time seemed to him to be crawling with,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"feet of lead, while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice.  He knew what was waiting,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"for him there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,his burning lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and driven the eyeballs back into their cave.  It was useless.  The,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"brain had its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"masks.  Then, suddenly, time stopped for him.  Yes:  that blind,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"slow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"grave, and showed it to him.  He stared at it.  Its very horror made",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,him stone.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,At last the door opened and his servant entered.  He turned glazed eyes,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,again.  His mood of cowardice had passed away.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The man bowed and retired.  In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in,",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal canvas,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a shudder.",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,things that he had required for his dreadful work.  He began to wonder,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Narborough's drawing-room by bowing servants.  His forehead was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"throbbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,manner as he bent over his hostess's hand was as easy and graceful as,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,ever.  Perhaps one never seems so much at one's ease as when one has to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,play a part.  Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,tragedy of our age.  Those finely shaped fingers could never have,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and goodness.  He himself could not help wondering at the calm of his,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,double life.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,remains of really remarkable ugliness.  She had proved an excellent,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"wife to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"husband properly in a marble mausoleum, which she had herself designed,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and married off her daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"devoted herself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and French _esprit_ when she could get it.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Dorian was one of her especial favourites, and she always told him that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"she was extremely glad she had not met him in early life.  ""I know, my",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dear, I should have fallen madly in love with you,"" she used to say,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake.  It is most",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"fortunate that you were not thought of at the time.  As it was, our",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"However, that was all Narborough's fault.  He was dreadfully",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"short-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"never sees anything.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her married",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"matters worse, had actually brought her husband with her.  ""I think it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"is most unkind of her, my dear,"" she whispered.  ""Of course I go and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"pure unadulterated country life.  They get up early, because they have",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"so much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,think about.  There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I will try to be there, Harry,"" he said, leaving the room.  As he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"drove back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,he thought he had strangled had come back to him.  Lord Henry's casual,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,his nerve still.  Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed.  He,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,winced.  He hated the idea of even touching them.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Yet it had to be done.  He realized that, and when he had locked the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,thrust Basil Hallward's coat and bag.  A huge fire was blazing.  He,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,piled another log on it.  The smell of the singeing clothes and burning,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,leather was horrible.  It took him three-quarters of an hour to consume,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"everything.  At the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Suddenly he started.  His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,nervously at his underlip.  Between two of the windows stood a large,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,lapis.  He watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,almost loathed.  His breath quickened.  A mad craving came over him.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,He lit a cigarette and then threw it away.  His eyelids drooped till,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek.  But he still watched,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the cabinet.  At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"lying, went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,spring.  A triangular drawer passed slowly out.  His fingers moved,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"instinctively towards it, dipped in, and closed on something.  It was a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"small Chinese box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the sides patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads.  He opened it.,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,persistent.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"face.  Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock.  It was twenty",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"minutes to twelve.  He put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"he did so, and went into his bedroom.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray,",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"in the dripping mist.  The public-houses were just closing, and dim men",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors.  From,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter.  In others,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,drunkards brawled and screamed.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"to him on the first day they had met, ""To cure the soul by means of the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"senses, and the senses by means of the soul.""  Yes, that was the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"secret.  He had often tried it, and would try it again now.  There were",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"opium dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,new.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull.  From time to time a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it.  The,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy.  Once the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile.  A steam rose from,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the horse as it splashed up the puddles.  The sidewindows of the hansom,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the soul!""  How the words rang in his ears!  His soul, certainly, was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,sick to death.  Was it true that the senses could cure it?  Innocent,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,blood had been spilled.  What could atone for that?  Ah! for that there,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done?  Who",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,had made him a judge over others?  He had said things that were,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,step.  He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him.  His throat burned,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and his delicate hands twitched nervously together.  He struck at the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,horse madly with his stick.  The driver laughed and whipped up.  He,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"laughed in answer, and the man was silent.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"sprawling spider.  The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"thickened, he felt afraid.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Then they passed by lonely brickfields.  The fog was lighter here, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"he could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"fanlike tongues of fire.  A dog barked as they went by, and far away in",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed.  The horse stumbled in a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"rough-paven streets.  Most of the windows were dark, but now and then",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind.  He,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,watched them curiously.  They moved like monstrous marionettes and made,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,gestures like live things.  He hated them.  A dull rage was in his,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"heart.  As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"an open door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,yards.  The driver beat at them with his whip.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,It is said that passion makes one think in a circle.  Certainly with,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he had found in",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and justified, by",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,still have dominated his temper.  From cell to cell of his brain crept,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"man's appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,became dear to him now for that very reason.  Ugliness was the one,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"reality.  The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"disordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"vivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"shapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song.  They were what he needed",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,for forgetfulness.  In three days he would be free.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane.  Over,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,masts of ships.  Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,yards.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Somewhere about here, sir, ain't it?"" he asked huskily through the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,trap.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Dorian started and peered round.  ""This will do,"" he answered, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"promised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay.  Here and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman.  The,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,light shook and splintered in the puddles.  A red glare came from an,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,outward-bound steamer that was coaling.  The slimy pavement looked like,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,a wet mackintosh.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,was being followed.  In about seven or eight minutes he reached a small,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories.  In one of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the top-windows stood a lamp.  He stopped and gave a peculiar knock.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"unhooked.  The door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,word to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,shadow as he passed.  At the end of the hall hung a tattered green,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,in from the street.  He dragged it aside and entered a long low room,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,which looked as if it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrill,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"flaring gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"faced them, were ranged round the walls.  Greasy reflectors of ribbed",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"tin backed them, making quivering disks of light.  The floor was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"covered with ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and stained with dark rings of spilled liquor.  Some Malays were,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"crouching by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"showing their white teeth as they chattered.  In one corner, with his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"head buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,tawdrily painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"haggard women, mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"coat with an expression of disgust.  ""He thinks he's got red ants on",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"him,"" laughed one of them, as Dorian passed by.  The man looked at her",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,in terror and began to whimper.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"darkened chamber.  As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"heavy odour of opium met him.  He heaved a deep breath, and his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"nostrils quivered with pleasure.  When he entered, a young man with",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"smooth yellow hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"pipe, looked up at him and nodded in a hesitating manner.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""You here, Adrian?"" muttered Dorian.",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,teaching them the secret of some new joy.  They were better off than he,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,eating his soul away.  From time to time he seemed to see the eyes of,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,which the duchess was presiding.  Her white hands were moving daintily,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"among the cups, and her full red lips were smiling at something that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Dorian had whispered to her.  Lord Henry was lying back in a,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"sat Lady Narborough, pretending to listen to the duke's description of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the last Brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection.  Three,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,young men in elaborate smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""What are you two talking about?"" said Lord Henry, strolling over to",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""But I don't want to be rechristened, Harry,"" rejoined the duchess,",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"a stifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall.  Everybody",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,started up.  The duchess stood motionless in horror.  And with fear in,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"his eyes, Lord Henry rushed through the flapping palms to find Dorian",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,He was carried at once into the blue drawing-room and laid upon one of,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,with a dazed expression.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""What has happened?"" he asked.  ""Oh!  I remember.  Am I safe here,",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"terror ran through him when he remembered that, pressed against the",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"time in his own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"indifferent to life itself.  The consciousness of being hunted, snared,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"tracked down, had begun to dominate him.  If the tapestry did but",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"tremble in the wind, he shook.  The dead leaves that were blown against",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"regrets.  When he closed his eyes, he saw again the sailor's face",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"peering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed once more to",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,lay its hand upon his heart.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him.  Actual,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,imagination.  It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,of sin.  It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"brood.  In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the good rewarded.  Success was given to the strong, failure thrust",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"upon the weak.  That was all.  Besides, had any stranger been prowling",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"round the house, he would have been seen by the servants or the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"keepers.  Had any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds, the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"gardeners would have reported it.  Yes, it had been merely fancy.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Sibyl Vane's brother had not come back to kill him.  He had sailed away,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"in his ship to founder in some winter sea.  From him, at any rate, he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was safe.  Why, the man did not know who he was, could not know who he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,was.  The mask of youth had saved him.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"And yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to think",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"visible form, and make them move before one!  What sort of life would",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"his be if, day and night, shadows of his crime were to peer at him from",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"silent corners, to mock him from secret places, to whisper in his ear",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"as he sat at the feast, to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep!",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"As the thought crept through his brain, he grew pale with terror, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder.  Oh! in what a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,wild hour of madness he had killed his friend!  How ghastly the mere,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,memory of the scene!  He saw it all again.  Each hideous detail came,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"back to him with added horror.  Out of the black cave of time, terrible",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and swathed in scarlet, rose the image of his sin.  When Lord Henry",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"came in at six o'clock, he found him crying as one whose heart will",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,break.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out.  There was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"something in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life.  But,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,it was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,caused the change.  His own nature had revolted against the excess of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,anguish that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,With subtle and finely wrought temperaments it is always so.  Their,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"strong passions must either bruise or bend.  They either slay the man,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,or themselves die.  Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.  The,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Besides, he had convinced himself that he had been the victim of a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"terror-stricken imagination, and looked back now on his fears with",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,something of pity and not a little of contempt.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"After breakfast, he walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party. The crisp,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,frost lay like salt upon the grass.  The sky was an inverted cup of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"blue metal.  A thin film of ice bordered the flat, reed-grown lake.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,At the corner of the pine-wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Clouston, the duchess's brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"the mare home, made his way towards his guest through the withered",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,bracken and rough undergrowth.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?"" he asked.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Not very good, Dorian.  I think most of the birds have gone to the",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Dorian strolled along by his side.  The keen aromatic air, the brown",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"beaters ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"that followed, fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"freedom.  He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,high indifference of joy.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of them, with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"forward, started a hare.  It bolted for a thicket of alders.  Sir",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was something in the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"animal's grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"cried out at once, ""Don't shoot it, Geoffrey.  Let it live.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""What nonsense, Dorian!"" laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"into the thicket, he fired.  There were two cries heard, the cry of a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,worse.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Good heavens!  I have hit a beater!"" exclaimed Sir Geoffrey.  ""What an",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"ass the man was to get in front of the guns!  Stop shooting there!"" he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"called out at the top of his voice.  ""A man is hurt.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Where, sir?  Where is he?"" he shouted.  At the same time, the firing",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,ceased along the line.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Here,"" answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""Why on earth don't you keep your men back?  Spoiled my shooting for",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"lithe swinging branches aside.  In a few moments they emerged, dragging",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,a body after them into the sunlight.  He turned away in horror.  It,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went.  He heard Sir,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the keeper.  The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,faces.  There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,voices.  A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,boughs overhead.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"After a few moments--that were to him, in his perturbed state, like",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""I am afraid so,"" rejoined Lord Henry.  ""He got the whole charge of",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,shot in his chest.  He must have died almost instantaneously.  Come;,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"let us go home.""",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"""What is?"" asked Lord Henry.  ""Oh! this accident, I suppose.  My dear",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"get in front of the guns?  Besides, it is nothing to us.  It is rather",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"awkward for Geoffrey, of course.  It does not do to pepper beaters.  It",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,about this thing at dinner.  I must tell them that the subject is to be,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,at the door by eight-thirty. He was determined not to sleep another,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"did not even put his silk scarf round his throat.  As he strolled home,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him.  He",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"heard one of them whisper to the other, ""That is Dorian Gray."" He",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"at, or talked about.  He was tired of hearing his own name now.  Half",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that no one knew who he was.  He had often told the girl whom he had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"lured to love him that he was poor, and she had believed him.  He had",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"told her once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,answered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly.  What a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,laugh she had!--just like a thrush singing.  And how pretty she had,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"been in her cotton dresses and her large hats!  She knew nothing, but",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,she had everything that he had lost.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him.  He sent",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Was it really true that one could never change?  He felt a wild longing,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"for the unstained purity of his boyhood--his rose-white boyhood, as",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Lord Henry had once called it.  He knew that he had tarnished himself,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,filled his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"had been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"joy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,been the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,shame.  But was it all irretrievable?  Was there no hope for him?,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,unsullied splendour of eternal youth!  All his failure had been due to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that.  Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,swift penalty along with it.  There was purification in punishment.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"Not ""Forgive us our sins"" but ""Smite us for our iniquities"" should be",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the prayer of man to a most just God.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"laughed round it as of old.  He took it up, as he had done on that",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,night of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"picture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"shield.  Once, some one who had terribly loved him had written to him a",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"mad letter, ending with these idolatrous words: ""The world is changed",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,because you are made of ivory and gold.  The curves of your lips,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"rewrite history.""  The phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"them over and over to himself.  Then he loathed his own beauty, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"flinging the mirror on the floor, crushed it into silver splinters",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"beneath his heel.  It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and the youth that he had prayed for.  But for those two things, his",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,life might have been free from stain.  His beauty had been to him but a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"mask, his youth but a mockery.  What was youth at best?  A green, an",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"unripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts.  Why had he",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,worn its livery?  Youth had spoiled him.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,It was better not to think of the past.  Nothing could alter that.  It,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think.  James",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Vane was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard.  Alan Campbell,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"had shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"secret that he had been forced to know.  The excitement, such as it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"was, over Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon pass away.  It was",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"already waning.  He was perfectly safe there.  Nor, indeed, was it the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind.  It was the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,living death of his own soul that troubled him.  Basil had painted the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,portrait that had marred his life.  He could not forgive him that.  It,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,was the portrait that had done everything.  Basil had said things to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"him that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience.  The",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"murder had been simply the madness of a moment.  As for Alan Campbell,",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,his suicide had been his own act.  He had chosen to do it.  It was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,nothing to him.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,A new life!  That was what he wanted.  That was what he was waiting,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,for.  Surely he had begun it already.  He had spared one innocent,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"thing, at any rate.  He would never again tempt innocence.  He would be",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,good.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in",The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"had been?  Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,every sign of evil passion from the face.  Perhaps the signs of evil,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,had already gone away.  He would go and look.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,He took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs.  As he unbarred the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"door, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"and lingered for a moment about his lips.  Yes, he would be good, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,to him.  He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,dragged the purple hanging from the portrait.  A cry of pain and,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"indignation broke from him.  He could see no change, save that in the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"the hypocrite.  The thing was still loathsome--more loathsome, if",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"possible, than before--and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"brighter, and more like blood newly spilled.  Then he trembled.  Had it",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed?  Or the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,laugh?  Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"finer than we are ourselves?  Or, perhaps, all these?  And why was the",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,red stain larger than it had been?  It seemed to have crept like a,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers.  There was blood on the,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"painted feet, as though the thing had dripped--blood even on the hand",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that had not held the knife.  Confess?  Did it mean that he was to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,confess?  To give himself up and be put to death?  He laughed.  He felt,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"that the idea was monstrous.  Besides, even if he did confess, who",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,would believe him?  There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,Everything belonging to him had been destroyed.  He himself had burned,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,what had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,They would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"his duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,atonement.  There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,earth as well as to heaven.  Nothing that he could do would cleanse him,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,till he had told his own sin.  His sin?  He shrugged his shoulders.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,The death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him.  He was thinking,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"of Hetty Merton.  For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,that he was looking at.  Vanity?  Curiosity?  Hypocrisy?  Had there,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,been nothing more in his renunciation than that?  There had been,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,something more.  At least he thought so.  But who could tell? ... No.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,There had been nothing more.  Through vanity he had spared her.  In,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness.  For curiosity's sake he,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,had tried the denial of self.  He recognized that now.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,But this murder--was it to dog him all his life?  Was he always to be,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,burdened by his past?  Was he really to confess?  Never.  There was,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,only one bit of evidence left against him.  The picture itself--that,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,was evidence.  He would destroy it.  Why had he kept it so long?  Once,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,it had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old.  Of,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,late he had felt no such pleasure.  It had kept him awake at night.,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,"When he had been away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,should look upon it.  It had brought melancholy across his passions.,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"conscience to him.  Yes, it had been conscience.  He would destroy it.",The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,,The Picture of Dorian Gray
174,He looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward.  He,The Picture of Dorian Gray

174,"was bright, and glistened.  As it had killed the painter, so it would",The Picture of Dorian Gray
